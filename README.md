###DPLA THUMBS

This is a barebones webapp created as a test for the [DPLA API](http://dp.la/info/developers/codex/). It returns thumbnails of resources returned from a simple keyword search.

Should be marginally useful for getting started with the API, constructing queries and exploring the data structure.
